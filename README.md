# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoder

This project detects credit card fraud using an unsupervised deep learning autoencoder.

## Project Structure
- `src/` contains modular Python code
- `main.py` is the runner script
- `data/creditcard.csv` is the dataset

## Methodology
- EDA
- Preprocessing (scaling)
- Stratified split
- Train only on normal class using 5-fold CV
- Evaluation using MSE thresholding
- Interpretability using SHAP

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run the pipeline
```bash
python main.py
```
